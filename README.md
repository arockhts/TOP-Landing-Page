# TOP-Landing-Page
TOP Landing Page project found at the end of the .CSS section of Foundations

Post-Project Findings:

Not very responsive. I find that I need to focus on utilizing css styles that work for me, not against me. To clarify, I find that I rely on finding specific pixel numbers rather than figuring out how to use css to automate what I want to do such as alignment, indentations, etc. However, I WILL IMPROVE! :)
